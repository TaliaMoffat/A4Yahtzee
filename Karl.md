# Karl's notes
* in the whoFirst() method, maybe comment that computer first = true while player first = false
* **PLEASE ADD MORE WHITESPACE**
* an alternative to the for loop on line 143 (for joining the array) is [this](https://howtodoinjava.com/java8/java-8-join-string-array-example/)
* line 213: should that be an else?
